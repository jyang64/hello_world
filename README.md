This README is for a lab in CSC 211. I created a repository using the GitHub Desktop Application, and then made commits. I published the repository to GitHub, and created a branch for my program, which I also published. I merged this branch with my master branch to commit the changes. I then collaborated with a partner.

## About

This repository contains a program that prints "Hello World!" to the command line.
